# Neuro Translate

Edge/Chromium extension that automatically translates webpages with the `gpt-5-nano` model. The popup lets you enter your API key, cancel translation on the current page, block the active domain, or disable the translator entirely.

## Installation
1. In Edge, open `edge://extensions` and enable **Developer mode**.
2. Choose **Load unpacked** and select the `extension` folder from this repository.
3. Open the popup, paste your API key, and ensure translation is enabled.

## Usage
- Pages are translated automatically when enabled and not blocked.
- Use the popup to cancel an in-progress translation on the current page.
- Block or allow the active domain via the popup buttons.
- Disable the translator globally with the toggle in the popup.
